# Contributing to Nephio

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Nephio! Nephio is an open project
and welcomes all contributors.

# Contributors
A list of contributors, including the current Technical Steering Committee (TSC)
membership, is in [CONTRIBUTORS.md].

In addition to the TSC, there are two types of contributors: 
 * *Contributors* include anyone in the technical community that contributes
   code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to Nephio.
 * *Committers* are Contributors that have earned the ability to merge pull
   requests in the Nephio GitHub repositories.

# How To Contribute

Contributors may submit pull requests to the Nephio repositories on GitHub. The
pull requests will be reviewed by at least one Committer who may decide to
accept or reject the pull request.

We are working on detailed guidance for contributors and will provide it here
when it is ready.
